# Technical Writing DocOps Course

Hello this is my readme file. I have no idea what to write here. I will continue writing because the requisites are to have one parragraph. As we know, parragraphs can't have only one sentence. Now that I have more sentences, I can stop writing.

I have two cats:
- Toribio
- Tilapia

Their daily routine is:
1. Eat
1. Sleep

| Cat's toys| Requirement |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Mouse | Required |
| Ball | Not Required|

```
{
  "firstName": "Toribio",
  "lastName": "The King",
  "age": 5
},
{
  "firstName": "Tilapia",
  "lastName": "The Queen",
  "age": 3
}
```
